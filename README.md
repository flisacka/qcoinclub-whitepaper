# QCoinClub Whitepaper 
v0.5
# Abstract

Members get access to the most exclusive venues, events, products, and experiences that are not available via other channels. We ensure the uniqueness of the services and products by asking selected top lifestyle brands to design unique experiences exclusively for us.

The service is provided via mobile web application, QCoinClubPortal. Access to the portal is granted only to the club members, and club member privileges are awarded only to holders of at least 1 QCN.

The QCoin token has been preminted to the amount of exactly 21000000 with 18 decimals. It will be initially distributed via air-drop and Gnosis Auction crowdsale. Separate pools will be reserved for distributions among club service and product providers and as QCoinClub reserve to cover future initiatives.

We strongly advocate a careful study of this whitepaper and all the documents referenced by it. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the QCN token sale and acquisition that should be taken into account. You may want to engage the services of appropriate experts to help you with the decision regarding QCoin.

The QCoin tokens are functional utility tokens designed for use only on the QCoinClubPortal and other QCoinClub software products that are yet to be developed. 

The tokens are not securities. In the event that you purchase QCoin, your purchase cannot be refunded or exchanged. Tokens do not entitle you to any equity, governance, voting, or similar right or entitlement in the QCoinClub, Flisacka Sp. z o. o. or in any of its affiliated companies.
# QCoinClub

QCoinClub is a global, members-only luxury lifestyle club and concierge service backed by QCoin, a tradable ERC-20 token. Members get access to exclusive venues, events, products, and experiences that are not available via other channels.
## QCoin

QCoin (QCN) is a limited supply cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain and the ERC-20 standard. It has three practical functions for club members and stakeholders:

1. It is a membership token that authenticates members and authorizes access to QCoinClub's benefits.
2. It stores the QCoinClub membership tier information: 1 QCN = Tier 1 Member, 2 QCN = Tier 2 Member, 3 QCN = Tier 3 Member, and so on.
3. It is also tradeable like any other cryptocurrency, with the potential to appreciate in value and become an investment in itself.

It's important to highlight that QCoin has not been designed as an instrument that can be used to pay for products or services (inside or outside of the club). Instead, it's a token proving one's membership in the club.

Additionally, given the tradable nature of the token (and the fact it can appreciate in value), Luxury lifestyle businesses receive a certain amount of QCoin for participation in the project, giving them a stake in the total market value of the QCoin itself and an incentive to join the project.
## QCoinClubPortal

QCoinClub's benefits are facilitated by the electronic portal utilizing both Ethereum blockchain as well as traditional web software stack in the backend. The portal is the main channel of interaction between members, club staff, and service providers. It's also a tool to browse and reserve the luxury services and products available to members.

Ongoing development of the portal is carried out; with each subsequent iteration providing a certain number of new features, improvements, and bug fixes. The long-term aim is to open the development roadmap as much as possible to the club members, whereby it's the members who decide on the priority of work. The governance of this model is to be further discussed and developed.
## Access to the portal

The QCoinClubPortal uses Ethereum wallets to authenticate the members and also to provide information about the tier of their membership. In practical terms, to access the system an individual must acquire and transfer QCoin to their non-custodial wallet and then connect the wallet to the portal. The more QCoin an individual holds, the higher the membership tier he/she gets. Individuals with 0 QCN in their wallets are considered non-members and denied access to the portal.

QCoin can be purchased via popular cryptocurrency exchanges on the current market prices or obtained via the air-dop, crowdsale, or by another type of exchange, donation, etc.

There is no other way of becoming a club member than obtaining at least one QCoin, which is equivalent to Tier 1 Membership.

## Unique products & services 

The services, products and other benefits offered by the club via the portal are also tiered, with some available only to the higher tier individuals, while others also enjoyable by the lower tiers. 

To ensure the membership in the club has a certain exclusive value, we take extra care to make products and services unique to the QCoinClub and not available via other channels.

The product types offered by the club include, but are not limited to:
* skip-the-line entry to exclusive golf clubs, night clubs, social clubs, etc,
* VIP places at cultural and sports events,
* private concerts,
* private celebrity events,
* pre-launch access to luxury fashion products.
* Michelin-star and gourmet dining,
* 5-star superior accommodation,
* personal health and wellbeing,
* personal coaching and training,
* luxury interior design services for homes, yachts, jets, etc,
* privately commissioned art and music,
* private travel advisory,
* general concierge services.

## Third-party providers

The physical provision of the products and services is carried out by third-party companies that are in contract with the club to provide such services. During the onboarding process, we ask selected top lifestyle brands to design unique experiences exclusively for us.

To incentivize third parties to join the network (and design unique experiences for the club), we reserve a pool of QCoin to be used as a reward. Third parties are rewarded one-off amount of QCoin from this pool, giving them a stake in the total market value of the QCoin itself.

Additionally, the vesting mechanism is in place to ensure coins are released in stages after a certain amount of value is delivered by the third-party provider.

Ongoing development of the benefit offered is ensured. The long-term aim is to open this process as much as possible to the club members, whereby it's the members who decide on the type of services and products that are offered. The governance of this model is to be further discussed and developed.

## Fees

Providers charge their standard fees in fiat currency for the services and products they offer via the club, while the club charges standard transaction fees (also in fiat currency). The portal uses an on-line payments solution to charge either the full value of the product or the initial transaction fee, with the remaining value of the product to be settled directly with a provider at the time of provision.

Although cryptocurrency payments are not currently being considered, they are not being ruled out.

Apart from third-party fees and transaction fees, no extra membership payments are charged.

# QCoin token economy
## Supply

The total supply of the QCoin is set to be exactly 21000000 (21 mln) with 18 decimals.
## Distribution

The initial supply of QCoin has been divided into three pools, each with a specific purpose:

| Pool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 1000000 | Initial public distribution via the means of air-drop (1000) and crowdsale (999000) |
| 10000000 | Pool reserved for third party supplier onboarding |
| 10000000 | Pool reserved as a QCoinClub treasury to support future developments. The tokens from this pool will be sold in crowdsales, given away in air-drops, or used to onboard new third parties. |

## Governance

QCoin's Smart Contract implements only the most essential ERC-20 functions. This has been decided to meet the key design goals for the QCoin token: 
1. QCoin is a membership token of a utility nature used only to authorize access to the QCoinClubPortal
2. QCoin is freely tradable
3. QCoin is decentralized

As a result, there are no functions in the smart contract, apart from what ERC-20 requires, that would leave the supply, tradability or value of the coin in the hands of a single entity or individual.

### No Minting

QCoin has been preminted to the exact amount of 21000000 QCN with 18 decimals. QCoin smart contract doesn't allow minting of any more tokens. This decision has been made to guarantee the exclusivity of the QCoinClub and also to ensure the decentralization of the coin itself. Minting will never be a factor that affects the supply and the market price of the token.

### No Mining

No new QCoins will ever be mined. The supply is exactly 21000000 QCN and that supply is preminted on the blockchain.

### No Burning

QCoin contract doesn't have any built-in token burning functions. Although "burning" via transferring them to inactive accounts is still possible due to the very nature of the blockchain itself, the smart contract doesn't support any explicit burn functions.

### Free-Trading

The QCoin is tradabale like other ERC-20 assets. Although initially a number of coins will be kept by the club in a reserved pool to be used as an incentive for service providers, no restrictions will be introduced to the tradability of the QCoin.

To ensure liquidity, the decision has been made to introduce 18 decimals so that fractions of QCoin can also be traded.

### QCoin as a governance token

QCoin is not a security. As such, it does not guarantee equity, co-ownership, vote, nor any governing power over QCoinClub, Flisacka Sp. z o. o., nor any other company or stakeholder in the QCoinClub project. Instead, it's a membership token of a utility nature that is used to authenticate and authorize club members to access club services and products.

# Architecture

QCoinClub's architecture consists of a number of high-level architectural components:
## Hybrid Dapp

QCoinClubPortal is a member front-end, architected in a "hybrid DApp" model. It means that although it is built as a traditional centralized web application, it does have elements that interact directly (via web3) and rely on decentralized Smart Contracts running on Ethereum blockchain.

## Microservices Layer

The microservices layer provides a set of centralized services for the QCoinClubPortal front-end. The web application communicates with the microservices via the RESTful API interface using GraphQL. 

The microservices layer provides the following functionality (among others):
* Content provision & categorisation
* Content personalisation
* Search
* Session management
* Payments
* Bookings
* Order fulfillment
  
Microservices are deployed in the AWS cloud leveraging serverless technology and other cloud-native services.
## Smart contract

QCoin is a standard ERC-20 smart contract deployed on Ethereum blockchain. It has been built using OpenZeppelin Contracts library, a de facto standard for implementing many Ethereum contract types, including ERC-20. OpenZeppelin helps to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities by providing battle-tested, community reviews code.

QCoinClubPortal front-end communicates with the smart contract via web3 libraries and a set of helper technologies, including WalletConnect and Infura.

Working in conjunction with standard capabilities of Ethereum blockchain QCoin smart contract implements two key uses cases for QCoinClub members. It provides authentication by means of Etherum wallet connectivity (WalletConnect) and authorization by providing the membership tier bound to the amount of QCoin held in the wallet.
## Back-office applications

QCoinClub will also include a number of back-office business applications, including a Content Management System (CMS), Order Management System (OMS), Business Information System (BI/MI), etc.
