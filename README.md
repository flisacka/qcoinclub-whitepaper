# QCoinClub

QCoinClub is a global, members-only luxury lifestyle club backed by QCoin, a tradable ERC-20 token. Club members get access to the most exclusive venues, events, products and experiences that are not available via other channels. 
## QCoin

QCoin (QCN) is a limited supply cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain and the ERC-20 standard that has has three practical functions for club members and stakeholders: 
1. It is a membership token that authenticates members and authorises access to QCoinClub's benefits. 
2. It stores the QCoinClub membership tier information: 1 QCN = Tier 1 Member, 2 QCN = Tier 2 Member, 3 QCN = Tier 3 Member and so on.
3. It is also tradeable like any other cryptocurrency, with a potential to appreciate in value and become an investment in itself.

It's important to highlight that QCoin has not been designed as an instrument that can be used to pay for products or services (inside or outside of the club. Instead, it's a token proving one's membership in the club. Additionally, given the tradable nature of the token (and the fact it can appreciate in value), Luxury lifestyle businesses receive a certain amount of QCoin for participation in the project, giving them a stake in the total market value of the QCoin itself and an incentive to join the project.
## QCoinClubPortal

QCoinClub's benefits are facilitated by the electronic reservation portal utilising both Ethereum blockchain as well as traditional web software stack in the backend. The portal is the main channel of interaction between members, club's staff and service providers. It's also a tool to browse and reserve the luxury services and products available to members.

Ongoing development of the portal is carried out, with each subsequent iteration providing certain number of new features, improvements and bug fixes. The long term aim is to open the development roadmap as much posible to the club members, whereby it's the members who decide on the priority of work. Goveranance of this model is to be further discussed and developed.
## Access to the portal

The portal uses Ethereum blockchain to authenticate the members and also to provide the information about the tier of their membership. In practical terms, to access the system an individual must purchase and transfer QCoin to their non-custodial wallet and then connect the wallet to the portal. The more QCoin an individual holds, the higher the membership tier he/she gets. Individuals with 0 QCN in their wallets are considered non-members and denied access to the portal.

QCoin can be purchased via popular cryptocurrency exchanges on the current market prices, or obtained via the air-dop, crowdsale or by other type of exchange, donation, etc.

There is no other way of becoming a club member than obtaining at least one QCoin, which is an equivalent to Tier 1 Membership.

## Unique products & services 

The services, products and other benefits offered by the club via the portal are also tiered, with some available only to the higher tier individuals, while others also enjoyable by the lower tiers. 

To ensure the membership in the club has a certain exquisite value, we take extra care to making products and services unique to the QCoinClub and not available via other channels. .

The product types offered include, but are not limited to:
* skip-the-line entry to exclusive golf clubs, night clubs, social clubs, etc,
* VIP places at cultural and sport events,
* private concerts,
* private celebrity events,
* pre-launch access to luxury fashion products.
* michelin-star and gourmet dining,
* 5-star superior accommodation,
* personal health and wellbeing,
* personal coaching and training,
* luxury interior design services for homes, yachts, jets, etc,
* privately commissioned art and music,
* private travel advisory,
* general concierge services.

## Third party providers

The physical provision of the products and services is carried out by third party companies that are in contract with the club to provide such services. During the the onboarding process we ask selected top lifestyle brands to design unique experiences exclusively for us.

To incentivise third parties to join the network (and design unique experiences for the club), we reserve a pool of QCoin to be used as a reward. Third parties are rewarded a one off amount of QCoin from this pool, giving them a stake in the total market value of the QCoin itself.

Additionally, the vesting mechanism is in place to ensure coins are released in stages after a certain amount of value is delivered by the third party provider.

Ongoing development of the benefit offering is ensured. The long term aim is to open this process as much as possible to the club members, whereby it's the members who decide on the type of services and products that are offered. Goveranance of this model is to be further discussed and developed.

## Fees

Providers charge their standard fees in fiat currency for the services and products they offer via the club, while the club charges standard transaction fees (also in fiat currency). The portal uses an on-line payments solution to charge either full value of the product or initial transaction fee, with the remaining value of the product to be settled directly with a provider at the time of provision.

Altough cryptocurrency payments are not currently being considered, they are not being ruled-out.

Apart from third party fees and transaction fees, no extra membership payments are charged.

# Incentive loop

> TBC

# QCoin token economy
## Supply

21000000 (21 mln) with 18 decimals
## Distribution

1000000 - Initial public distribution via the means of air-drop (1000) and crowdsale (999000)

10000000 - Pool reserved for third party supplier on-boarding

10000000 - Pool reserved as a QCoinClub treasury to support future developments. The tokens from this pool will be sold in crowdsales, given away in air-drops or used to onboard new third parties.

## Governance

By design QCoin has been built as a simple smart contract that only implements the most essential ERC-20 functions. This decision has been made to meet the key design goals for the QCoin token: 
1. QCoin is a membership token of utility nature used to authorise access to QCoinCoinClub via QCoinClubPortal
2. QCoin is freely tradable
3. QCoin is decentralised

There are no functions in the smart contract, apart from what ERC-20 requires, that would leave the supply, tradability or value of the coin in the hands of a single entity or individual.

### No Minting

QCoin has been preminted to the exact number of 21000000 QCN with 18 decimals. QCoin smart contract doesn't allow minting of any more tokens. This decision has been made to quarantee the exclusivity of the QCoinClub and also to ensure a decentralisation of the coin itself. Minting will never be a factor that affects the supply and the market price of the token.

### No Mining

No new QCoins will ever be mined. The supply is exactly 21000000 QCN and that supply is preminted on the blockchain.

### No Burning

QCoin contract doesn't have any built-in token burning functions. Although "burning" via transferring them to the inactive accounts is still possible due to the very nature of the blockchain itself, the smart contract doesn't support any explicit burn functions.

### Free-Trading

The QCoin is tradabale like other ERC-20 assets. Although initially number of coins will be kept by QCoinClub in a reserved pool to be used as an incentive for service providers to join the club, no restrictions will be introduced to the tradability of the QCoin.

To ensure liquidity, the decision has been made to introduce 18 decimals, so that fractions of QCoin can also be traded.

### QCoin as a governance token

QCoin is not a security. As such, it does not give a stake, co-ownership nor any governing power over QCoinClub, Flisacka Sp. z o. o., nor any other company or stakeholder involved. Instead, it's a membership token that is used to authenticate and authorise club members to access club's services and products.

# Architecture

The architecture of QCoinClub has been founded on the several design goals:

1. The QCoinClubPortal is to be accessible via web, mobile and other electronic channels.
2. The authentication and authorisation is to be ensured by the Etereum blockchain using custom ERC-20 token (QCoin)
3. The two use cases of the QCoin token are:
   *  to identify and authenticate QCoinClub members,
   *  to control membership tiers.
4. The QCoin token is to be tradable on popular exchanges.
5. The QCoin token is to be decentralised, so that it "governs itself" using all the mechanisms that are natively built-in to the blockchain.

Furthermore, the five architectural princiles are as follows:
* Easy to use
* Flexible & agile
* Stateless & scalable
* Secure & resilient by design
* Automated

## Application stack

### DApp
### Ethereum

Goal no. 2 and 3 are ensured by the nature of Ethereum blockchain itself, that is: 1) built in authentication of participants, 2) tamper-proof data store.

QCoinClub uses Ethereum as the underlying decentralised blockchain that enables numer of key design goals. 

Authentication ensured by private keys.

Blockchain accounts

Decentralised integrity, tamper proof.

The smart contract functionality enable developers to deploy programs that leverage the distributed nature of the blockchain
### ERC-20

Goal no. 4 has been supported by utilising ERC-20 standard. 

ERC-20 is an Ethereum standard that enables 

### OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a de facto standard for implementing many Ethereum contract types, including ERC-20. QCoin has been build on-top of OpenZeppelin ERC-20 library to inherit all the industry good-pratices:

* List those good practices.

### Smart Contract

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.
